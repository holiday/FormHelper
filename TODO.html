TODO:
- Implement Observer/Observable Automatic Data Retrieval for the form
- Complete all Form Fields
- Create PHPUnint testcases and check to make sure everything is consistent
- Implement Validation via Rules
- Possibly implement HTML support files to wrap fields? (will eliminate tabbing problems but will be expensive)

PROBLEMS:
- Fieldsets do not support multiple innerItems
- Data retrieval will need to be forwarded to each item within Labels/Fieldsets
- Fix tabbing problems with fields
- Multiple select should not place 'select' as a default option, remove it i.e. it causes problems with data updating from $_POST
- Remove fieldsets or any field types that does not hold a value or is directly dealing with form data
